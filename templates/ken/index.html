                    I began writing code at the age of 14, making scripts for IRC and playing around with HTML. In highschool, my code writing took a journey from BASIC to Pascal to C and finally C++. While my college career was focused heavily on the Microsoft stack, I also learned how to program microcontrollers, Xbox games, and got my first introduction to the web of client-server with PHP. I chose a career in Software Engineering because I recognized that designing and writing applications was something I had enough passion in to carry forward into the later part of my life wit infinite passion. I am a maker, a tinkerer, a person who likes to see how things are designed and marvel at just how much machines can accomplish with such elegant engineering. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first experience in the industry was with a web development agency in downtown Portland, Oregon. I was working on an ASP.NET CMS framework that was in use by several clients for their e-commerce websites. A year later the agency dissolved and I quickly formed my own LLC to be able to freelance my skills and talents. Determined to continue to be a part of a dev team I began working for a product company, also on the .NET stack, and was brought onto their systems team to focus on their web portal. Following my time with that company I decided to put my full time efforts into contracting and working remotely, so I started working with another agency on a couple of Wordpress/PHP projects and went traveling. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I returned to Portland I had learned enough to know that being on a team was important to me. I had been looking to open source my development projects and was keen on finding a team of others who also shared the open source mindset, thus I found myself at another web development agency in downtown working on projects using nodejs with javascript both on the server and client side. I have to say that I am in love with single language development stacks! Now, whenever I start a new project I advocate for it being open source and I dedicate my life to a balance between working in an office and working outside of an office.
