    I began writing code at the age of 14, making scripts for IRC and playing around with HTML. In
    highschool, my code writing took a journey from BASIC to Pascal to C and finally C++. While my
    college career was focused heavily on the Microsoft stack, I also learned how to program
    microcontrollers, Xbox games, and got my first introduction to the web of client-server with
    PHP. I chose a career in Software Engineering because I recognized that designing and writing
    applications was something I had enough passion in to carry forward into the later part of my
    life with infinite passion. I am a maker, a tinkerer, a person who likes to see how things are
    designed and marvel at just how much machines can accomplish with such elegant engineering.

    My first experience in the industry was with a web development agency in downtown Portland,
    Oregon. I was working on an ASP.NET CMS framework that was in use by several clients for their
    e-commerce websites. A year later the agency dissolved and I quickly formed my own LLC to be
    able to freelance my skills and talents. Determined to continue to be a part of a dev team I
    began working for a product company, also on the .NET stack, and was brought onto their systems
    team to focus on their web portal. Following my time with that company I decided to put my full
    time efforts into contracting and working remotely, so I started working with another agency on
    a couple of Wordpress/PHP projects and went traveling.

    When I returned to Portland, in 2016, I had learned enough to know that being on a team was
    important to me. I had been looking to open source my development projects and was keen on
    finding a team of others who also shared the open source mindset, thus I found myself at another
    web development agency in downtown working on projects using nodejs with javascript both on the
    server and client side. I have to say that I am in love with single language development stacks!
    Now, whenever I start a new project I advocate for it being open source and I dedicate my life
    to a balance between working in an office and working outside of an office.

    Portland is great and Oregon will always be home to me. I had joined the
    Clevertech team in 2019 and am finally enjoyed the freedom, autonomy, and balance I have long sought in
    my career. While working from home for most of 2020, and seeing the world change, I took the time to invest
    in the open source projects that I was passionate about. Now, as a senior developer, I am seeking to
    change how open source is percieved by clients and to change how IP is automagically awarded in
    my industry. I desire to see library code freed from the private and proprietary grips of
    companies who have no interest in evolving the code and to see original author accreditations go
    to those who put fingers to keyboards.
