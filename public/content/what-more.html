    I have a passion for helping people with technology and software solutions, my goal is to help people do what they are already doing more efficiently. I like building entire applications for fun, but realize that a lot of people just need something quick and easy, so I'm open to short term projects as well as long term solutions.

    For my own fun I created a nodejs framework called QUASI - Quick, Usable, And Simple Interface. My goal is to provide a web framework that makes small content websites simple for content managers and easy to extend for developers. <a href="https://github.com/KenEucker/quasi" target="_blank"><i>See the github project for more.</i></a>

    Most of the work I do is behind the scenes, which means that the better job I do the more unlikely you are to be able to notice it. I have a mind for the functional and when I connect technologies, they just work. I am actively growing my skills on the artistic, aesthetically pleasing, and streamlined aspects of UX with software and am a student of the sciences of human-computer interaction.
