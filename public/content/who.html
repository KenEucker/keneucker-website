    I am a full stack web developer, classically trained in object-oriented programming, who likes to write universal javascript, with extensive experience building the backend of web-connected properties.  I have a diverse set of skills writing in the serverside languages C#, PHP, Javascript, and the clientside languages HTML, Javascript, CSS, TypeScript, including the database languages mysql, MSSQL, and Mongodb. I currently work on WordPress applications using React and specialize in updating broken legacy applications to headles/rendered/restful/progressive modern applications.
