    I have a passion for helping people with technology and software solutions, my goal is to help
    people do what they are already doing more efficiently. I like building entire applications for
    fun, but realize that a lot of people just need something quick and easy, so I'm open to short
    term projects as well as long term solutions.

    BikeTag.Org is a project that I started with a friend back in 2018 after they approached me with an 
    app idea. The idea was simple: create a tool to play the game of BikeTag easier than it was currently 
    being played. So that year we launched a tool that uploaded two images (found it tag, new mystery location) 
    and provided fields for credit and a hint for the next round. That project continues to evolve and we 
    have successfully scaled the project to include 7 cities across the world including: Indianapolis, Indiana, 
    Inverness, Scotland, and Vienna, Austria! I started this endeavor as an entirely open source project. You
    can see how that project is <a href="https://github.com/keneucker/biketag-website/projects">managed on GitHub, here.</a>

    Most of the work I do is behind the scenes, which means that the better job I do the more
    unlikely you are to be able to notice it. I have a mind for the functional and when I connect
    technologies, they just work. I am actively growing my skills on the artistic, aesthetically
    pleasing, and streamlined aspects of UX with software and am a student of the sciences of
    human-computer interaction.

    Over the years I have built several stacks for myself. Currently, I am hacking away on a project
    called sexpress. <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/sexpress">Sexpress</a> is a configurable
    framework built around express for multitenant web applications. Sexpress runs the BikeTag app
    and is also the webserver for BikeTag.Org (and all of it's regional games at
    {city}.biketag.org). Sexpress provides developers a way to scale from a single page of html and
    no supporting API code to a fully secure, API driven, multitenant, set of Single Page Apps that
    has a universe of other features bundled within. Sexpress is the current evolution of the
    perfect stack that I've been developing over the last two decades, written entirely in
    javascript.
