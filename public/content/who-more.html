    I am a writer; I write in human languages and in machine languages. I like writing poetry and
    short stories. I like writing blogs and reflecting upon my personal experience. I have written
    different blogs over the years trying to find out where my niche is. I have been building a
    universe for a novel that I want to write entirely in javascript. I have some odd ideas.

    I am a maker; I woodwork, weld metal, solder electronics, program microcontrollers, and I like
    to find projects that combines these skills. I have a desire to create kinetic water art
    installations.

    I'm an adventurer; I like to go biking, hiking, backpacking, and traveling to remote areas to
    connect with the natural world and I find those experiences to be invaluable. I like to believe
    that life happens in between the moments that you plan for, and I actively seek out adventures
    that will grow who I am as a person with those around me.
